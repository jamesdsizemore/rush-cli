# Rush architecture

Rush is a Python 3.12 package with two transports and one implementation layer. Click CLI commands and FastMCP tools invoke the same objects from `src/rush/tools/`; external programs are isolated behind adapters in `src/rush/engines/`.

## Core contracts

- `TOOL_SPECS` and `ENGINE_SPECS` are declarative metadata; `ALL_TOOLS` and `ENGINES` are executable registries. Tests enforce parity across all 37 tools and 121 engines.
- `ToolFn.run(path, *, config, ...)` is the internal execution surface. `ToolFn.__call__` is MCP-facing and must expose only JSON-schema-safe parameters.
- ToolResult required keys are `tool`, `engine`, `engine_version`, `status`, `duration_ms`, `summary`, `findings`, and `raw`; optional extensions include metrics, artifacts, metadata, and review fields.
- A missing optional executable returns `skipped`; it must not raise or install anything.
- Multi-engine aggregation is deterministic: worst status wins (`error > fail > warn > ok > skipped`), durations sum, findings sort by location/rule/message, and provenance is retained.
- **Reporting Subsystems**:
  - `src/rush/sarif.py`: Multi-SARIF 2.1.0 generator for GitHub Security Scanning integration.
  - `src/rush/html_export.py`: Standalone, zero-dependency HTML interactive dashboard with dark mode and filterable finding tables.
- **Pluggable LLM Provider Architecture**:
  - `src/rush/providers/`: Provider abstraction decoupling Anthropic, OpenAI, and local LLM heuristics from CLI/MCP transport layers.
- **Binary Resolution Cache**:
  - `@lru_cache` in `src/rush/tools/common.py` avoiding expensive repeated `PATH` searches on Windows.

## Configuration flow

  Target --> Walk[walk upward]
  Walk --> Config{rush.toml?}
  Walk --> Git{.git boundary?}
  Config -- nearest --> Parse[typed dataclasses + tool-name validation]
  Parse --> Defaults[built-in defaults]
  Defaults --> Overrides[explicit CLI/tool args win]
  Git -- reached --> Stop[do not read parent checkout config]
```

## Engine flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant T as Tool
  participant R as Router
  participant E as Engine adapter
  participant P as External process
  T->>R: target + options
  R->>E: applicable files / project
  E->>P: deterministic argv, timeout, stdin detached
  P-->>E: captured exit/stdout/stderr
  E-->>T: normalized ToolResult
  T-->>T: aggregate, sort, redact
```

## Safety architecture

Stdio MCP stdout is reserved for JSON-RPC. Logs are stderr NDJSON. Engine processes cannot consume protocol input. Security-sensitive promoted adapters own config/environment constraints. Artifact writers validate target containment and overwrite intent. Browser/network/slow/fuzz/baseline/publication work is denied or skipped without explicit implemented permission.
